# Diabetic-Prediction
This is the Minor project of our 6th semester at KIIT University.

This prediction is based on two models Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network.
The file **Project_01.ipynb** is the prediction based on the Support Vector Machine and
the file **neural-networks.ipynb** is the prediction based on the Artificial Neural Network. The dataset for both
models is **diabetes.csv**. The **model.pkl**, **scalerfile2.sav**, and **test.py** are the files required to make the UI of the model.
